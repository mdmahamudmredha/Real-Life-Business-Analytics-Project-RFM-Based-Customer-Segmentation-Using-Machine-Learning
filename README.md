# Real Life Business Analytics Project: RFM-Based Customer Segmentation Using Machine-Learning Algorithm
This business analytics project leverages RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and k-Means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. The goal is to enable targeted marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and optimize resource allocation.

### 🔍 Overview

A real-world **Python-based marketing analytics project** where customers are segmented using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** model and then clustered using **K-Means**. This enables businesses to target specific groups like loyal customers, at-risk customers, and high-value shoppers based on purchase behavior.

This project demonstrates how RFM and ML clustering can be combined to generate **actionable business insights** from raw transaction data.

### 📌 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (KMeans)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Dataset: Online Retail (Excel/CSV)

### 📊 Key Concepts

- Customer Segmentation
- RFM Scoring & Clustering
- Business Intelligence
- Visual Analytics
- Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Interpretation of Clusters for Business Strategy

---

### 🛠 Techniques Used

- Handling Missing Values (CustomerID null logic)
- Feature Engineering: Recency (InvoiceDate), Frequency (InvoiceNo), Monetary (Quantity × UnitPrice)
- RFM Scoring (Log-transformed & scaled if needed)
- KMeans Clustering (with optimal k)
- Segment Labelling: Gold, Silver, Diamond using custom logic
- Insightful Features:
  - Revenue contribution by segment
  - Region-wise Diamond/Gold/Silver customers (pie chart)
  - CLV estimation
  - Churn risk detection
  - Monthly sales trend analysis

---

### 🧠 Advanced Business Insights Extracted

> We designed 15+ powerful analytics queries on top of RFM clusters, such as:

- What % of revenue comes from Diamond customers?
- From which regions do Diamond customers come?
- Which segment has the highest AOV?
- Are top 20% customers contributing to 80% of revenue?
- Month-over-month total sales trend
- Churn risk & win-back target groups
